The average person experiences queueing as a regular everyday occurrence. Queues can be effective in bringing order to systems where one entity must serve multiple customers. However, queues that move too slowly impose economic and psychological costs on customers, and have potential to harm profits for businesses. For this reason, individuals and businesses are looking for technology-based solutions that can help mitigate problems associated with long wait times in physical queues. Although plenty of solutions exist currently in the form of virtual queueing and online ticketing, access to them is limited due to several reasons such as cost, availability, and other factors. This project examines virtual queues as a solution to physical queueing problems, analyzes how virtual queues are developed and implemented in different contexts, and creates a methodology and design for a virtual queue management system that is both effective and accessible to any user.
